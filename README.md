# Edge-Case-Testing-on-Everyday-Objects-
A practical SQA assignment exploring edge case testing on everyday objects to demonstrate creative test case design, boundary analysis, and real-world quality assurance thinking.
# 🧠 Edge Case Testing on Everyday Objects



## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores **Edge Case Testing** applied to **everyday objects** — such as cups, doors, calculators, pens, or switches.  
The goal is to identify and analyze unusual, boundary, and unexpected conditions that could affect the usability or reliability of simple objects.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and apply edge case thinking beyond software systems.  
- Design creative and logical test cases for common physical objects.  
- Improve analytical and critical testing skills for real-world QA applications.

## 🧪 Scope
The project focuses on:
- Identifying **functional** and **non-functional** edge cases.  
- Testing how objects behave in **unusual or extreme** conditions.  
- Demonstrating a QA mindset through **detailed documentation** and **test analysis**.

## 🗂️ Deliverables
| Document Name | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Edge Case Test Scenarios** | Describes unique and unexpected cases for each everyday object. |
| **Test Cases Document** | Contains detailed steps, expected results, and analysis. |
| **Observation Report** | Summarizes key findings, insights, and learning outcomes. |

## 📊 Key Learning
- Enhanced understanding of **boundary value** and **negative testing** concepts.  
- Improved creativity in identifying hidden defects or limitations.  
- Applied QA mindset beyond digital applications.
